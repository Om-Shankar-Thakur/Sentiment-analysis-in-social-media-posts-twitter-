# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we implement a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression.

## 1. Logistic Regression

In this section, we implement logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

### 1.1 Sigmoid

We start by implementing the sigmoid function, a crucial component of logistic regression.

#### [Exercise 1 - sigmoid (UNQ_C1)](##exercise-1---sigmoid-unq_c1)

### 1.2 Cost function and Gradient

Next, we define the cost function and implement the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the model's parameters.

#### [Exercise 2 - gradientDescent (UNQ_C2)](##exercise-2---gradientdescent-unq_c2)

## 2. Extracting the Features

Before training our model, we need to extract features from the input data. We extract two features for sentiment analysis.

#### [Exercise 3 - extract_features (UNQ_C3)](##exercise-3---extract_features-unq_c3)

## 3. Training Your Model

We train the logistic regression model using the extracted features and labels.

## 4. Test your Logistic Regression

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our trained logistic regression model.

### 4.1 Check the Performance using the Test Set

We test the model on a validation set to assess its accuracy.

#### [Exercise 4 - predict_tweet (UNQ_C4)](##exercise-4---predict_tweet-unq_c4)

#### [Exercise 5 - test_logistic_regression (UNQ_C5)](##exercise-5---test_logistic_regression-unq_c5)

## 5. Error Analysis

We analyze the errors made by our model and explore ways to improve its performance.

## 6. Predict with your own Tweet

Finally, we provide a way for you to use the trained model to predict the sentiment of your own tweets.
